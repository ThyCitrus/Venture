Yeah, so hi.

This is literally just the source code for the project I am working on

The plan is to have it be available to all OSs, but I'll need someone to help package them when the time comes, as I am restricted to windows at the moment.

Cheers!

Until then, here is what I have on my checklist for things I've got needed to be done for this thing:

**Have Liam teach you that thing with github again because you’re a big goofy idiot that doesn’t know a damn thing about github
# He didn’t really help that much somehow, but talking to Perplexity for about 60 seconds got it working just fine, so
Status conditions / buffs and debuffs # probably done
World Map (ascii?) # Beautifully done**
Journal
Other minigames
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
Other minigames, as needed:

Fishing
Dungeon crawling (labrynth, enemy spawns, pure combat, probably ascii)
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
Journal (in inventory for the sake of simplicity? Press j in inventory?):

General info on characters, enemies, locations, etc
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# --------------------------------------------------------------------

So, with all that in mind, I will do my best to keep up with this here file, but I am a little new to using github like a proper and kind and respectful individual, 
so if I make mistakes and am just overall doing something wrong, please correct me but in like, a kind way so that way I don't feel bad, yeah? I want to be help, not infantalized.
